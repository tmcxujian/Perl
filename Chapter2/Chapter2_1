#Write a program that reads a list of strings on separate lines until end-of-input and prints out the list in reverse order. If the input comes from the keyboard, youâ€™ll probably need to signal the end of the input by pressing Control-D on Unix, or Control-Z on Windows.
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use warnings;

print "Enter some lines, then press Ctrl-D:\n";
@lines = <STDIN>;
@reverse_lines = reverse @lines;
 
print @reverse_lines;

#another way of writing this could be the following:

print "Second way: Enter some lines, then press Ctrl-D:\n";
print reverse <STDIN>;
